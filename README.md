# Video controls with JS

- play/pause
- stop
- jump 5 seconds back or forward
- increase or decrease volume

Events **onmouseover/onmouseout** to show/hide controls menu and to move the menu buttons up/down (instead of CSS :hover selector)

:world_map: The location sticker on the video works! :sunglasses:
